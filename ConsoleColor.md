**Configuring Console Colors**

You can manage colors of the IntelliJ IDEA consoles by customizing the values of the **Console Color** section. Thus, you can individually configure highlighting rules for input, error, and output messages of your console. 

These rules are applied only to the following types of consoles: standard console, Database console etc. To learn more about the consoles in the IntelliJ IDEA, see section [Using Consoles](UsingConsole.md) in chapter [Building, Running, Testing and Deploying Applications ](RunningApplications.md) 

The available console color options are listed in **Table 1**:

**Table 1. Console Color Options**
