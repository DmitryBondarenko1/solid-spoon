 **Introduction**

Console in IntelliJ is a much more advanced tool than a standard application console. Besides common functions like input and output it can change it's appearance according to your preferences and helps you write code more efficiently with it's smart functions:
    
 - Code completion 
 - Syntax check with inspections
 - Automated insertion of paired brackets, quotes and braces
 - Scrolling through the history of commands using the arrow keys 
 - Quick documentation lookup
 
 **Configuring Color Scheme**

As above said, you can flexibly tune IntelliJ's view according to your preferences. In particular, can individually configure color, font style, and highlighting rules for input, error, and output messages. Before you start customzing your console, make sure that the current color scheme you are working with is editable. Color schemes are various styles of how your editor looks like. 

Go to **Settings** -> **Editor** -> **Color Scheme**.

And select a color scheme you want to change.  Note that here you also have the ability to Export and Import color schemes. Schemes are saved in .icls, .jar or .xml format based on your needs. 

**Customizing Console Font** 
 
Now lets navigate to **Console Font** section where you can define your preferred font style, size, spacing and other font parameters. While Font, size, line spacing parameters are self-explanatory, **Fallback Font** parameter is used for symbols not supported by the main font. As you make your settings, font example is instantly shown in the preview at the bottom of the page.
